# Interview Checklist

We want to make it easier for people to prepare for interviews, especially for some of the largest tech companies. We would love to get feedback as we are still pushing out new features. You may also find a few design inconsistencies. Weâ€™ve utilized the T3 stack and Chakra UI in this project. Our code is also fully open-source, available here. The core features include:
    - ðŸ“ŠEasy progress tracking
    - ðŸ”—One-click link sharing
    - ðŸ“œCompany-specific lists

The problem list isnâ€™t exhaustive and we are still looking for more open-source data to make our list more extensive. We will slowly push out more theme options and improve our front end but the main functionality is mostly done. We want to hear about the bugs you find as this is the beta version. If you have any improvements to suggest, we are all ears!

Thanks to everyone who helped us test this out!
